A Survey on Smart Solar Tracker System with Smart Meter Integration using IoT
Global energy demands and the push for sustainability have accelerated the adoption of decentralized renewable energy sources like rooftop solar. However, the efficiency of fixed-tilt solar panels is significantly compromised as the sun's position changes throughout the day.Solar trackers address this by continually aligning the panel perpendicular to the sun's rays, substantially increasing the daily energy yield.Simultaneously, effective energy management requires real-time data on generation, storage, and consumption—the function of a smart meter. The Sun Solar Tracker System with Smart Meter Integration is an advanced renewable energy solution designed to maximize the efficiency and performance of solar power generation. In this system, a solar tracker automatically adjusts the position of solar panels to follow the sun’s path throughout the day, ensuring that the panels receive maximum sunlight at all times.This project successfully merges these two concepts: an affordable single-axis solar tracker and an IoT-enabled smart meter, built upon the versatile ESP32 platform and low-cost sensors. This combined system offers an optimized micro-generation and monitoring solution ideal for off-grid or residential applications.
This significantly increases the energy output compared to fixed solar panel installations. The tracking mechanism is typically controlled using light sensors (LDRs) and a microcontroller or IoT-based controller, which determine the optimal angle for panel alignment.The smart meter integration adds an intelligent monitoring and control feature to the system. It enables real-time measurement of power generation, consumption, and grid interaction through sensors and wireless communication. The data collected by the smart meter can be transmitted to a cloud platform or mobile application, allowing users to monitor system performance, energy usage, and efficiency remotely. By combining solar tracking and smart metering, this system not only enhances energy generation but also promotes efficient power management, cost savings, and sustainability. This makes it highly suitable for modern smart grid applications and eco-friendly energy systems.
